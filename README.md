# LinuxDesktopFiles
.desktop files for a few apps when I get the urge to hop Linux distributions. These files are required for certain applications to show up as applications in the GNOME desktop enviroment.


code.desktop == Visual Studio Code


sublime_text.desktop == Sublime Text 2


eclipse.desktop == Eclipse



dotDesktop is a bash sell script for auto generating a template for a desktop file,saving the template to .local/share/applications, and opening the template with vim.
